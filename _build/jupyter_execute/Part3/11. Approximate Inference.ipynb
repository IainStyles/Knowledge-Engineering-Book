    "# Approximate Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We have recently demonstrated that exact inference is rather non-trivial. It's conceptually straightforward, but practically difficult and very expensive, scaling very badly with the number of variables. It also **fails completely** for continuous variables where the calculations involved are essentially intractable. For these reasons it very rare to use this approach in practice. So what do we do instead? The dominant class of algorithm for inference on Bayesian networks is based on *sampling* and we will now study two approaches to sampling. The first is the *direct sampling* method which is straightforward but inefficient. The second is *Markov Chain sampling* and specifically *Gibbs sampling*. This is the dominant method in the practical application of Bayesian networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direct Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a coin and we want to know its distribution of heads vs tails if we toss it. How can we do this? We cannot determine the distribution easily from first principle, although we typically make some assumptions about the symmetry of the coin to conclude that $P(H)=P(T)=0.5$. How could we verify that our assumptions were correct though?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very simple answer to this. We *sample* the distribution by tossing the coin a large number of times ($N$) and counting how many times each of the two outcomes occurs ($N_H, N_T$). We then estimate the distribution as $P(H)=N_H/N$ and $P(T)=N_T/N$. If the number of heads is roughly equal to the number of tails then we have approximately verified that that coin is fair and that $P(H)=P(T)$. We can simulate a fair coin using the Binomial Distribution with $p=0.5$"
