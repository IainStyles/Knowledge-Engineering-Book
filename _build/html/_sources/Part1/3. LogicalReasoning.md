# Logic and Knowledge

A major component of intelligence is the ability to **reason**: to take our knowledge of the world and use it to work out what might happen if we take a particular decision. Logic is the study of *reasoning*. More specifically it is about *correct* reasoning: constructing arguments and making inferences in ways that follow directly from a set of premises. Given the two statements

- All humans are mortal
- Socrates is a human

it must follow that

- Socrates is mortal

This is an example of a *deductive truth*: a true statement that can be deduced from the first two statements. It is not possible for the first two statements to be true, and for the third to be false. Note that the converse is not necessarily true: neither of the first two statements can be deduced from the third. 

The two statements "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" form a very simple example of a **knowledge base**. They are not data: although the second statement could conceivably be deduced from some sort of data, the first certainly could not be as no matter how much data we have about mortality rates, this would never allow us to definitively rule out a counterexample. Nevertheless, we know definitively that this must be true because of our understanding of human biology.The statement that "all men are mortal" is a known fact and is thus described as **knowledge** rather than as data. Here are three more statements about the world that would be considered as knowledge rather than data:

- It is normally colder in the winter than in the summer.
- Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world.
- Water makes you wet.

All of these statements are True, but not all can be easily be deduced from data. The first two statements are known to be True because we have measurements of seasonal temperatures and heights of mountains. However, the third statement, whilst undoubtedly True, would be very difficult to deduce from data.

As well as being True, these statements are also **grounded** in the world. We understand the concept of a mountain and that it is related to measurements of height; we know what the seasons are and that temperature is influenced by them; and we know what water is and what it means to be wet. The proper grounding of statements into "knowable" concepts is important when determining the correctness of an argument (a chain of reasoning). We will be exploring this in more detail in the section on [soundness and validity](section:soundness-validity)

Truths can sometimes - but not always, and not always easily - be extracted from a set of data. For example, that Everest is the tallest mountain in the world should be easily identifiable from an appropriate dataset. The fact that water makes you wet is unlikely to be quite so easily discernable from data alone. For this reason, we refer to these *facts* about the world as **knowledge**. In the forthcoming section on [knowledge bases][section:knowledge-bases] we will see how we can formally represent knowledge. Before we reach that stage though, we will find it helpful to develop a formal framework that will establish a rigourous basis for correctly reasoning about a world represented by a set of knowledge statements and to draw conclusions and make inferences based on those statements. That framework is **logic** and we will now introduce some of the fundamental concepts. We will begin with a type of logic called **propositional logic**, which will allow us to reason over statements of fact.




# Propositions

Statements of fact such as "*water makes you wet*" are called **propositions** and they are fundamental to the construction of arguments in logic. A proposition is a statement can either be either True or False. Thus, "*it is raining*" is a proposition whereas "*is it raining?*" is not.

There are two type of proposition:

> - **Premises**, which are stated and may be considered as *axioms* (things that are known)
> - **Conclusions**, which are derived purely from the Premises.

For example,

> Socrates is a man [*Premise*]   
> All men are mortal [*Premise*]  
> Therefore, Socrates is mortal [*Conclusion*]

Propositions may also be composed of multiple **atomic propositions** joined by **connectives**. Each atomic proposition must be a valid proposition that can be evaluated as True or False in isolation, for example (connectives in *bold):

> - The car is blue and fuelled by petrol (*The car is blue* **and** *the car is fuelled by petrol*)
> - Books have hard or soft covers (*Books have hard covers* **or** *books have soft covers*)
> - If the sun is shining then it is daytime (**If** *the sun is shining* **then** *it is daytime*)

(section:correctness)=
## Argument Correctness

When we construct a logical argument, we will, quite naturally, be concerned about whether that argument is correct

1. The sun only shines during the daytime; It is daytime; Therefore, the sun is shining.
2. It only rains during the nighttime; It is raining; There, it is nighttime.
3. The sun only shines during the daytime; The sun is shining; Therefore, it is daytime.

One of these arguments is correct; the other two are incorrect but for different reasons.

The first argument is incorrect because the conclusion does not follow if the two premises are True. This argument is not **valid**. 

The second argument is also incorrect, but for a different reason. If the two premises were True then the argument would be Valid. However,  
first premise is clearly not True and so this cannot be a correct argument. An argument in which one or more of the premises is not True is not **sound**.

If one of the premises turned out to be false, the argument would still be valid, but it would no longer be **sound**.

The third argument is both sound and valid: the two premises are True (sound), and if the premises are True then the conclusion is also True (valid). This is therefore a *correct* argument. When we refer to arguments as being correct, we mean that they are both *sound* and *valid*.
