# Exercise 1: Are you Logical?

1. Is the following argument correct? If not, find the logical flaw.

- Siobhan only has fish for dinner on Fridays.
- It is not Friday.
- Therefore, Siobhan will not be having fish for dinner.

```{dropdown} **Solution**
:class: dropdown
This is a valid argument.
```

2. Is the following argument correct? If not, find the logical flaw.
- If you have an MSc in AI then you will get a good job.
- Declan has a good job.
- Therefore, Declan has an MSc in AI.


```{dropdown} **Solution**   
This argument is false because the first statement does not state that all good jobs required an MSc in AI.
```

3. Is the following argument correct? If not, find the logical flaw.
- If there is smoke there is a fire.
- There is no snoke.
- Therefore there is no fire.


```{dropdown} **Solution**   
This is a false argument because statement (a) does not preclude the possibility of a fire without smoke, which is not explicitly ruled out by the premises.
```


4. Is the following argument correct? If not, find the logical flaw.
- If it is cold, John wears a coat.
- John is not wearing a coat.
- Therefore, it is not cold.


```{dropdown} **Solution**   
This is a valid argument.
```


5. Which of the following statements are equivalent?
- Kerry carries an umbrella when it is raining.
- Kerry does not carry an umbrella when it is not raining.
- Kerry carries an umbrella unless it is not raining.


```{dropdown} **Solution**   
The first statement tells us what Kerry does when it is raining (carry an umbrella), but does not tell what she does when it is not raining.

The second statement tells us that Kerry does not an umbrella when it is not raining, but does not say anything about what she does when it is raining. It is therefore not equivalent to statement (a).

The third statement tells us that when it is raining, Kerry carries an umbrella, and that when it is not raining, she does not carry am umbrella.

Therefore, none of the statements are equivalent.
```


6. This is a harder question that requires multiple stages of reasoning

Ahmed, Chen, and Niamh are three friends. They went for dinner together one evening. They decided that they wanted to try all of the items on the menu so they all chose a different main course and a different dessert. The menu options for the main course were Pizza, Daal, and Falafel. For dessert, the choices were Apple Pie, Cheesecake, and Ice Cream. Given the five statements below, can you work out who ordered what?

1. The person who had the Pizza did not have the Apple Pie.
1. Niamh had the Daal.
1. Ahmed did not have Cheesecake.
1. Chen had the Apple Pie.
1. The person who had the Ice Cream did not have the Falafel.


```{dropdown} **Solution**   
We can made the following deductions:  
a) Ahmed had Ice Cream: he did not have cheesecake (by 3) or Apple Pie (by 4)  
b) Ahmed had Pizza: he did not have Daal (by 2) or Falafel (by 5 and a)  
c) Niamh had the Cheesecake: she did not have Apple Pie (by 5) or Ice Cream (by a)  
d) Chen had the Falafel: she did not have Ice Cream (by a) or Cheesecake (by c)
Combined with the choices stated explicitly in statements 2 and 4 we deduce that:

- Ahmed had Pizza and Ice Cream
- Chen had Falafel and Apple Pie
- Niamh had Daal and Cheesecake
```
