# Exercise 2: Elementary, my dear Watson

1. Which of the following statements are *propositions*?

    a) The sun does not shine at night.  
    b) All dogs are brown.  
    c) Go over there.  
    d) The book was on the table.  
    e) It takes 3 minutes to soft-boil an egg.  
    f) Dogs chase cats.  
    g) If it is daytime and there are no clouds then the sky is blue.  
    h) It was raining and I got wet.  
    i) The pan is hot so don't put it on the worktop.  
    j) Who needs enemies when you have friends like that?

```{dropdown} **Solution**   
Propositions are statements of fact. All of the statements state facts except for (c) and (i) which are instructions, and (j) which is a question.

Note that the truth of a sentence does not determine whether it is a proposition of not, so statement (b) is a proposition, but is one that is False.
```

2. Identify the atomic propositions in the following statements

    a) If it is daytime and there are no clouds then the sky is blue.  
    b) Headaches can be treated with Aspirin or Paracetamol.  
    c) Birds and Bats can both fly.  

```{dropdown} **Solution**   
a) ("it is daytime", "there are no clouds", "the sky is blue").   
b) ("Headaches can be treated with Aspirin", "Headaches can be treated with paracetamol").  
c) ("Birds can fly", "Bats can fly")
```

3. Are the following arguments valid, sound, neither, or both?
    a)
        i) Birmingham is not a city in the country of Northern Ireland.  
        ii) QUB is not in the city of Birmingham.   
        iii) Therefore QUB is in the country of Northern Ireland.

    b) 
        i) QUB is in the city of Birmingham.  
        ii) QUB is in the country of Northern Ireland.  
        iii) Therefore the city of Birmingham is in the country of Northern Ireland.

    c)
        i) If it is nighttime the sun does not shine.  
        ii) The sun is not shining. [you may assume this to be true]  
        iii) Therefore it is nighttime.

    d)
        i) If it is nighttime the sun does not shine.  
        ii) The sun is shining. [you may assume this to be true]  
        iii) Therefore it is not nighttime.

```{dropdown} **Solution**   
a) This is sound but not valid. The conclusion cannot be drawn from the premises.  
b) This is a valid argument because the conclusion follows from the premises, but is not sound because the first premise is false.  
c) This is sound (all premises are true) but it is not valid because the premises do not specify what the sun does when it is not nighttime. For example, the sun does not shine when it is cloudy during the daytime.  
d) This is both valid and sound. The first premise means that the sun cannot shine at night.
