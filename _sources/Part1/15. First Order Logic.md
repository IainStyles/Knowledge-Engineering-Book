# First Order Logic

## Introduction

We have been studying propositional logic which has allowed us to reason over a set of sentences which can each be evaluated as being True or False. 

> All computer scientists are logical
> Alan is a computer scientist
> Therefore Alan is logical

Each of these sentences is a proposition: they can all be evaluated as True of False. Can we prove this argument using propositional logic? Our arguments might be something like

> If a person is a computer scientist then they are logical.
> Alan is a computer scientist.
> Therefore Alan is Logical.

Or, using obvious notation,

> $C\implies L,\ A\implies C,\ A\ :\ L$

This argument seems to stand up, but the definition of the atomic propositions $A$, $C$, and $L$ is rather important here. We might define
 - $C$: The person is a computer scientist
 - $A$: The person is called Alan
 - $L$: The person is logical

This seems rather inelegant and clumsy. Most importantly, if we also decided that we wanted to check whether Niamh and Chen were logical, we would have to construct separate proofs for them. If we also decided that Physicists and Philosopher were all logical as well, then we have a combinatorial explosion of arguments to prove. Propositional Logic becomes even more convoluted if you consider an argument such as:

> All computer scientists are logical
> Some computer scientists are Irish
> Therefore, some computer scientists are logical and Irish.

This argument includes *quantifiers* (all, some) that we do not have natural mechanisms for working with in propositional logic. We circumvented this in the previous argument by careful definitions of the sentences but we cannot apply that trick here. We need some new mechanisms.

# First order Logic

In propositional logic, all of our propositions have to be unconditionally True or False. This makes it difficult to construct generic arguments, or to construct sentences that are conditionally dependent on some variable. First order logic extends propositional logic to include mechanisms for reasoning over statements that include *variables* (Alan), *quantifiers* (all/some), and *predicates* which are propositions with conditions. For this reason we will refer to the system of logic we are about to describe as **predicate calculus**.

## The Ingredients of Predicate Calculus

Predicate calculus includes some new concepts that enable us to reason

### Variables
Denoted as $x$, $y$, $z$, etc. 

### Predicates
Predicates are statements that are similar to proposition, but for which their Truth depends on the value of an associate variable or variables. For example $P(x)$: "x is a Philosopher" is true when $x$ is "Socrates" and is False when $x$ is "Donald Trump".
Predicates are denoted as $P$, $Q$, $R$ etc. 

### Quantifiers
There are two common quantifiers:

> $\forall$, meaning 'for all' (universal quantifier)

For example, given person $x$ and predicate $P(x)$ ($x$ is a philosopher) and $L(x)$ ($x$ is logical) we may write "all philosophers are logical as"

> $\forall\ x\ [P(x)\implies L(x)]$

Read literally, this states that "if person $x$ is a philosopher then $x$ is logical for all people". Notice that we use implication here to allow for the possibility of logical people who are not philosophers. What would the following expression mean?

> $\forall\ x\ [P(x)\land L(x)]$

The second common quantifier is

> $\exists$, meaning 'exists' (existential quantifier)

We may therefore write "some philophers are Irish" as

> $\exists\ x\ [P(x)\land I(x)]$

This can be read as "There is at least one person who is both a Philosopher and Irish". We may have been tempted to write:

> $\exists\ x\ [P(x)\implies I(x)]$.

What does this expression mean? When using quantifiers, you need to think quite carefully about which logical connectives you should be using. It is not difficult to make mistakes. It can sometime be helpful to think about familiar examples.

We can also use logical connectives with quantifiers. For example,

> $\exists\ x\ [C(x)]\ \land\ \lnot\forall\ x\ [L(x)]$

means "some people are computer scientists and not all people are logical".


## Duality of Quantifiers

Consider the following two pairs of statements:

 > $\forall\ x\ [C(x)]\quad\iff\quad\lnot\exists\ x\ [\lnot C(x)]$

 and

 > $\exists\ x\ [C(x)]\quad\iff\quad\lnot\forall\ x\ [\lnot C(x)]$

 Are these statements True?

What about the following statements?

> $\forall\ x\ [\lnot C(x)]\quad\iff\quad\lnot\exists\ x\ [C(x)]$

and

> $\exists\ x\ [\lnot C(x)]\quad\iff\quad\lnot\forall\ x\ [C(x)]$


The quantifiers $\forall$ and $\exists$ are said to be **dual** to each other. We can always write predicates written using one quantifier in terms of the other. This will be an important tool when constructing proofs in predicate calculus.

## Predicates with multiple arguments

Predicate calculus gives us the freedom to introduce predicates that are conditional on more than one variable. Consider the following sentence:

$x$ was outstanding at $y$ and also highly proficient at $z$

The sentence is true for $(x,y,z)=(\mathrm{Alan\ Turing, Computer\ Science, long\ distance\ running})$ but is not true for $(x,y,z)=(\mathrm{Donald\ Trump, Computer\ Science, long\ distance\ running})$ and so this is a valid predicate that is conditional on multiple values.

We do not have a way to construct such as sentence yet so we create one by allowing predicates to take multiple arguments. For example, we could define the sentence above as $S(x,y,z)$ and then apply the same ideas as we have already used. Predicates with one argument are called *unary* predicates, those with two arguments are called *binary* predicates. In general, predicates with $n$ arguments are called $n$-ary predicates. Those with zero arguments are referred to as *nullary* predicates, or by an alternative name that we have already seen. Can you think of what this is?

## Semantics of Predicates

In the propositional logic we introduced a distinction between the validity and soundness of arguments. The same ideas are applicable in predicate calculus. Arguments that are "correct" must be both valid (correctly argued) and sound (based on correct premises). Sentences or predicates must be either True or False and this requires them to be grounded in some **domain** and subject to an **interpretation** which governs how a truth value should be assigned to a given statement. Consider the simple predicate

> $\forall\ x  [P(x)]$

This is clearly a well-formed predicate. But is it True? We cannot know without knowing what $F$ means and what $x$ is. To determine the truth of this sentence, we need to define the interpretation of $P(\cdot)$ and the domain of $x$ - the range allowable values of $x$. We cannot determine the semantics (ie the meaning) of this sentence and therefore its Truth without these. Let us define an interpretation that $P(x)$ is defined as "$x$ has two wheels". If $x$ is defined on the domain "bicycles", then our sentence is True by (bi?) definition.

If we were to change the definition of $P(\cdot)$ to be "$x$ has feathers and wings" but leave the domain unchanged then our sentence is now False. Similary if we were to change only the domain of $x$ to be "birds", then the sentence would be False. If we were to change both domain and interpretation, then the predicate would be True.

## Validity of Predicate Arguments

As in propositional logic, we can construct arguments in which we attempt to derive new predicates that 
That is, given a set of premises which are true, we will be constructing and proving arguments that lead to True conclusions and are therefore **valid**. Notice that this is independent of the interpretation which affects only the truth of the premises: the truth of the premises affects only whether the argument is sound.

An argument is valid iff
- The conclusion is True in every possible domain for every possible interpretation in which the Premises are True.

An argument is invalid iff
- There exists a combination of domain and interpretation in which the premises are True and the conclusion is False.

Thus, the following argument is valid: if the premise is True, then the conclusion must be True irrespective of the domain of $x$ or the interpretation.

> $\forall\ x  [P(x)]\ :\ \exists\ x\ [P(x)]$

The following argument is invalid: there are domains in which the premise is True but the conclusion is False.

> $\exists\ x  [P(x)]\ :\ \forall\ x\ [P(x)]$

## Proofs in First Order Logic

Proofs in First order Logic are very similar to those in propositional logic, except that we now have to worry about how to handle the quantifiers. Four new rules will enable us to do this.

### $\forall$-elimination
The basic idea here is that if a formula is universally quantified, then we can infer a particular instance

> 1. $\forall x [\phi(x)]$
> 2. $\phi(a)$

This is related to $\land$-elimination because $\forall x [\phi(x)] \equiv \phi(a) \land\phi(b)\land\phi(c)\dots$

### $\exists$-introduction
Given a particular instance we can infer an existential quantification

> 1. $\phi(a)$
> 2. $\exists x [\phi(x)]$

This is related to $\or$-introduction because $\exists x [\phi(x)] \equiv \phi(a) \lor\phi(b)\lor\phi(c)\dots$


### $\forall$-introduction

> 1. $\phi(a)$
> 2. $\forall x [\phi(x)]$

We can only do this if we know nothing else about the particular instance $a$.

### $\exists$-elimination
