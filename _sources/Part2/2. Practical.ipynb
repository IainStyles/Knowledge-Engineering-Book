substances, AhR has recently become an emerging pharmacological target in cancer, immunology, inflammatory conditions, and aging.', 'Multiple AhR ligands are recognized, with plant occurring flavonoids being the largest group of natural ligands of AhR in the human diet.', 'The biological implications of the modulatory effects of flavonoids on AhR could be highlighted from a toxicological and environmental concern and for the possible pharmacological applicability.', 'Similar to other AhR modulators, flavonoids commonly exhibit tissue, organ, and species-specific activities on AhR.', 'Flavones, flavonols, flavanones, and isoflavones are the main subclasses of flavonoids reported as AhR modulators.', 'Some of the structural features of these groups of flavonoids that could be influencing their AhR effects are herein summarized.', 'However, limited generalizations, as well as few outright structure-activity relationships can be suggested on the AhR agonism and/or antagonism caused by flavonoids.'], ['Our literature review confirmed that these chemicals may disturb thyroid hormones homeostasis, activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and induce oxidative stress, which in turn may initiate a chain of events resulting in impairment of cochlea and hearing loss.'], ['In this view point, we (i) summarize the existing evidence to support a role of environmental toxicants other than UVR in the pathogenesis of EILs, (ii) we argue that activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling by UVR and environmental toxicants is critically involved in triggering and sustaining a crosstalk between melanocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which then causes the development and persistence of EILs in human skin, and (iii) we discuss clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of EILs resulting from this concept.'], ['Gene pathway analysis unveiled gene networks involved in the regulation of various cellular functions, including acute response to oxidative stress via up-regulation of antioxidative gene transcripts controlled by nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2), and up-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-controlled

significant effect on lung function in COPD, older adults and whites (P for interaction <0.05).', 'CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that accelerated ageing is associated with the development of COPD and impaired lung function.', 'Smoking cessation and anti-ageing therapy have potential significance in COPD.'], ['EXPERT OPINION: There is limited data on the epidemiology of emphysema in LMIC, where more than 90% of deaths from COPD occur and where the morbidity of HIV is most heavily concentrated.'], ['Purpose: Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite endpoint developed to quantify the impact of pharmacological treatment in clinical trials for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also showing a prognostic value.', \"CID is defined as any of the following condition: forced expiratory volume in 1 s decrease >=100 mL from baseline, and/or St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score increase >=4-unit from baseline, and/or the occurrence of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation of COPD.\", 'Although most COPD patients experience a clinical worsening as they get older, to date, no specific studies assessed the correlation between ageing and CID in COPD.', 'Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ageing on CID in COPD patients.', 'Patients and Methods: Data obtained from 55219 COPD patients were extracted from 17 papers, mostly post-hoc analyses.', 'A pairwise meta-analysis and a meta-regression analysis were performed according to PRISMA-P guidelines to quantify the impact of pharmacological therapy on CID and to determine whether ageing might modulate the risk of CID in COPD patients.', 'Results: Inhaled treatments resulted generally effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD (relative risk: 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.84; P < 0.001).', 'Conclusion: This quantitative synthesis suggests that inhaled therapy is effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD, although such a protective effect may be affected in older patients with impaired lung function.', 'Further studies specifically designed on CID in COPD are needed to confirm these results.'], ['Having less than eight years of

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of global mortality, trailing only cardiovascular diseases and cancers.', 'Results: The findings expound that individuals grappling with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often undergo intricate cognitive and emotional experiences, necessitating holistic solutions that consider psychological processes, contextual factors, and subjective age.', 'Conclusion: This article concludes that the lens of gerontology is invaluable in comprehending chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly due to its association with old age and increased longevity.', \"Breathlessness, a cardinal symptom, often overlaps with normal age-related declines in pulmonary function, rendering COPD's insidious onset misconstrued as a consequence of aging-related changes.\"], ['Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contributes significantly to the death of people worldwide, especially the elderly.', 'An essential feature of COPD is pulmonary inflammation, which results from long-term exposure to noxious substances from cigarette smoking and other environmental pollutants.', 'Pulmonary inflammatory mediators spill over to the blood, leading to systemic inflammation, which is believed to play a significant role in the onset of a host of comorbidities associated with COPD.', 'A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment.', 'The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles.', 'Furthermore, the use of medications to treat cognitive impairment symptomatology in COPD patients has been reported to be associated with life-threatening adverse effects, hence the need for alternative medications with reduced side effects.', 'In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients.', 'The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed.', 'Interestingly, omega-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain.', 'Thus, clinical studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in managing cognitive impairment in COPD patients.'], ['PURPOSE: Swallowing impairment is a serious extra-pulmonary manifestation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).', 'Previous studies suggest that individuals with stable COPD show atypical values for several videofluoroscopy measures of swallowing, compared to healthy adults under age 60.', 'In this study, we aimed to clarify how swallowing in people with stable COPD differs from age-matched healthy controls.', 'METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of videofluoroscopy data from two previously-collected datasets: a) a sample of 28 adults with stable COPD (18 male); b) a sample of 76 healthy adults, from which 28 adults were selected, matched for sex and age to participants in the COPD cohort.', 'RESULTS: Across the consistencies tested, participants with COPD showed significantly shorter durations of LVC, earlier onsets and shorter durations of UES opening, and reduced pharyngeal constriction.', 'CONCLUSION: These results point to features of swallowing in people with stable COPD that differ from changes seen with healthy aging, and which represent risks for potential aspiration.'], ['Advancing age is the most important risk factor for the development of and mortality from acute and chronic lung diseases,

proteomic (CITE-seq), and T cell receptor repertoire analysis on lung tissue from patients with mild-moderate COPD (n=5, GOLD I or II), emphysema without airflow obstruction (n=5), end-stage COPD (n=2), control (n=6), or donors (n=4).', 'We validated in an independent patient cohort (N=929) and integrated with the Hhip(+/-) murine model of COPD.', 'MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mild-moderate COPD lungs have increased abundance of two CD8+ T cell subpopulations: cytotoxic KLRG1+TIGIT+CX3CR1+T effector memory CD45RA+(TEMRA) cells; and DNAM-1+CCR5+T resident memory (TRM) cells.', 'In an independent cohort, the CD8+KLRG1+TEMRA gene signature is increased in mild-moderate COPD lung compared to control or end-stage COPD lung.', 'Human CD8+KLRG1+TEMRA cells are similar to CD8+ T cells driving inflammation in an aging-related, murine model of COPD.', 'CONCLUSIONS: CD8+ TEMRA cells are increased in mild-moderate COPD lung and may contribute to inflammation that precedes severe disease.', 'Further study of these CD8+T cells may have therapeutic implications for preventing severe COPD.'], ['Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have at least one additional, clinically relevant chronic disease.', 'Those with the most severe airflow obstruction will die from respiratory failure, but most patients with COPD die from non-respiratory disorders, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancer.', 'As many chronic diseases have shared risk factors (eg, ageing, smoking, pollution, inactivity, and poverty), we argue that a shift from the current paradigm in which COPD is considered as a single disease with comorbidities, to one in which COPD is considered as part of a multimorbid state-with co-occurring diseases potentially sharing pathobiological mechanisms-is needed to advance disease prevention, diagnosis, and management.', 'The term syndemics is used to describe the co-occurrence of diseases with shared mechanisms and risk factors, a novel concept that we propose helps to explain the clustering of certain morbidities in patients diagnosed with COPD.', 'A syndemics approach to understanding COPD could have important clinical implications, in which the complex disease presentations in these patients are addressed through proactive diagnosis, assessment of severity, and integrated management of the COPD multimorbid state, with a patient-centred rather than a single-disease approach.'], ['There was a high prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus (32.1%), hypertension (26.7%), hypotension (20%), skin diseases
