# Ontologies

Central to the creation of knowledge graphs is the notion of a *grammar* that the graph must obey. Just as grammars for languages determine that whilst the phrase "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" is properly constructed, the phrase "fox the brown quick over jumped dog lazy the" is not, an ontology specifies what a properly constructed graph must look like. Just as different languages have different grammars, so do different knowledge graphs.

An ontology for a knowledge graph will typically provide a formal specification of the following: 

* What types of entities/nodes and edges are allowed.
* What types of node can be connected by each type of edge.
* What attributes each type of node and edge can have.

The ontology is usually derived from domain knowledge. For example, in a graph of medical conditions, it would not make sense to have nodes of type `organ` and `gene` connected by a relation of type `is_treated by`, whereas this relation would be perfectly reasonable between nodes of type `disease` and `drug`.

Ontologies specify only the general structure of the graph, what it contains, what can be connected etc. In our earlier example, it would specify that there are entities/nodes for `programs`, `modules`, `staff`, and `students`, and it would specifify which of these nodes can be in a relationship. What the ontology does not do, however, is specify the data itself. This is  added according to the design defined by the ontology, but does not make up part of the ontology itself.

## Ontology Representations

### Graphical representations
One of the most common ways to represent an ontology is diagrammatically. We have seen several examples of informal diagrammatic approaches, and these will continue to be the mainstay of our approach. There are, however, other more formal diagrammatic approaches. These can be extremely useful and powerful because a formall diagram can be parsed by software to automatically generate a formal specification in one of the other formats. Perhaps the most common format for such diagrams is *UML* - Unified Modelling Language. This was originally devised for use in modelling of software systems, but it provides all of the mechanisms necessary for modelling knowledge graphs and are often used by practising software engineers who need to model data because of their familiarity with the diagrammatic style.

Most software engineering practioners do not use formal UML in practice, preferring instead to use informal diagrams that borrow some features from UML where theyt help to express the problem. We will share in this spirit and informal diagrams will be our main tool for designing knowledge graphs. Where this approach breaks down though, is when we need a formal representation of the graph so that it can be implemented. For this, formal approaches to representing the ontology are required.

### Triples-based formats

Perhaps the simplest way to represent knowledge graphs is so-called *triples*-based formats. In this format, the graph is represented simply as triples of `(relation, source entitiy, target entity)`. For example:

```
(is_a, dog, mammal)
(is_a, cat, mammal)
(chases, dog, cat)
```
(Can you draw the graph of this?)

This format, with some modifications, is extremely widely used, and we will look at several examples of this. Very often, the triple will be extended into a general $n$-tuple in which additional elements represent other aspects of the relation. Properties of the entities will often be recorded in a separate file. This format is often widely used to distribute graphs themselves, and not just their ontology.

This representation has the distinct advantage of being very easy to parse, and can be translated almost directly into a computer program. However, it has the disadvantage of not containing any explanations. For this, mark-up languages are often used instead.

### N-Triples Markup

An extension of the $N$-triples format introduces a mark-up element which provides explanatory context. This representations was originally designed for representing meta-data on the world-wide web. Accordingly, much of the specification is in terms of URLs. Here is an example drawn from the [W3C RDF Primer](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/) which can perhaps be considered as the canonical reference on this topic. It describes a web resource that makes statements "there is a Person identified by http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me, whose name is Eric Miller, whose email address is e.miller123(at)example (changed for security purposes), and whose title is Dr." In the N-Triples format, 

* The first element of the triple is the *subject* (in this case, a web page).
* The second element is a *predicate*, also specified as a URL, that specified  the nature of the relation.
* The third element is the *object*, which could be a URL or could be a literal.
* Each triple is terminated with a period (.)

The N-Triples representation of this example is therefore:

```
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>             <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person> .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName>         "Eric Miller" .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox>          <mailto:em@w3.org> .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle>    "Dr." .
```

This representation is very easy to parse, but is extremely verbose and lacks structure and explanation. For this reason, other formats are often preferred.

### Turtle: Terse RDF Triple Language

The Turtle format is a little less verbose then the N-Triples format. It support the use of namespaces via a `prefix` statement, and nesting to allow the subject to be defined only once. Here is the same information in the Turtle format:

```
@prefix ns0: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#> .

<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me>
  a <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person> ;
  ns0:fullName "Eric Miller" ;
  ns0:mailbox <mailto:em@w3.org> ;
  ns0:personalTitle "Dr." .
```

### RDF/XML
A very common data format for ontologies and knowledge graphs is the RDF/XML format

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
             xmlns:contact="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#">

  <contact:Person rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me">
    <contact:fullName>Eric Miller</contact:fullName>
    <contact:mailbox rdf:resource="mailto:em@w3.org"/>
    <contact:personalTitle>Dr.</contact:personalTitle> 
  </contact:Person>

</rdf:RDF>
```

Careful scrutiny of this reveals the similarity between this and the Turtle format. The use of XML rather than a bespokje format allows the use of the huge variety of XML tools that are available for parsing, validation etc.

A useful [online converter](https://www.easyrdf.org/converter) is available to translate between these representations. 

### OWL: Ontology Web Language

OWL, the Web Ontology Language, is an extension of the RDF/XML format that provides a rich set of pre-defined semantics. The full OWL specification is far too complex to consider in this module, but we can see easily how OWL ontologies are specified using a simple example:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
         xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
         xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#"
         xml:base="http://www.dummy.info/new.owl"
         xmlns="http://www.dummy.info/new.owl#">

<owl:Ontology rdf:about="http://www.dummy.info/new.owl"/>

<owl:Class rdf:about="#Animal">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing"/>
</owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:about="#Dog">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing"/>
</owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:about="#Cat">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing"/>
</owl:Class>

<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#is_a">
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Dog"/>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Animal"/>
</owl:ObjectProperty>

<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#is_a">
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Cat"/>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Animal"/>
</owl:ObjectProperty>

<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#chases">
  <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Dog"/>
  <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Cat"/>
</owl:ObjectProperty>

</rdf:RDF>
In practice, we will almost never work with these representations directly because there are better tools available for working with knowledge graphs. We will soon introduce a Python-based tool for just that.
