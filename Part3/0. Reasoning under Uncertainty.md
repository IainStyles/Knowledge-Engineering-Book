# Reasoning under Uncertainty

Logic and Knowledge Graphs enable us to represent statements of fact, but we do not always have complete knowledge of the world and our knowledge is often uncertain. In this sectin we will develop techniques for represnting and reasoning over knowledge that is subject to uncertainty, developing a class of probabilistic models known as Bayesian Networks that will allow us to efficiently make inferences over uncertain knowledge.
