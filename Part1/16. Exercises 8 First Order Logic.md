# Exercises 8: First Order Logic
1. Using the following notation translate the following sentences into predicate notation. For person $x$:
- $C(x)$: $x$ is a computer scientist
- $L(x)$: $x$ is logical
- $I(x)$: $x$ is Irish

    a) Some people are logical.  
    b) All computer scientists are logical.  
    c) Some Irish people are computer scientists.  
    d) Some logical people are Irish computer scientists.  
    e) All Irish computer scientists are logical but not all Irish people are Computer Scientists.  
    f) Some logical people are not computer scientists.  
    g) Not all Irish people are computer scientists.  
    h) There are no computer scientists who are not logical

```{dropdown} **Solutions**

a) $\exists\ x\ [L(x)]$ . 
b) $\forall\ x\ [C(x)\implies L(x)]$  
c) $\exists\ x\ [I(x)\land C(x)]$  
d) $\exists\ x\ [L(x)\land I(x)\land C(x)]$  
e) $\forall\ x\ [I(x)\land C(x) \implies L(x)]\ \land\ \lnot\forall\ x\ [I(x)\implies C(x)]$    
f) $\exists\ x\ [L(x)\land \lnot C(x)]$  
g) $\lnot\forall\ x\ [I(x)\implies C(x)]$  
h) $\lnot\exists\ x\ [C(x)\land \lnot L(x)]$  
```

2. Using the following notation ***and the quantifier specified for each problem***, translate the following sentences into predicate notation. For person $x$:
- $C(x)$: $x$ is a computer scientist
- $L(x)$: $x$ is logical
- $I(x)$: $x$ is Irish

    a) Some people are logical [$\forall$].  
    b) All computer scientists are logical [$\exists$].  
    c) Some Irish people are computer scientists [$\forall$].  
    d) Some logical people are Irish computer scientists [$\forall$].  
    e) All Irish computer scientists are logical but not all Irish people are Computer Scientists[$\exists$].  
    f) Some logical people are not computer scientists [$\forall$].  
    g) Not all Irish people are computer scientists [$\exists$].  
    h) There are no computer scientists who are not logical [$\forall$]

```{dropdown} **Solutions**

a) $\lnot\forall\ x\ [\lnot L(x)]$ . 
b) $\lnot\exists\ x\ [\lnot(C(x)\land L(x))]$  
c) $\lnot\forall\ x\ [\lnot(I(x)\implies C(x))]$  
d) $\lnot\forall\ x\ [\lnot(L(x)\land I(x)\land C(x))]$  
e) $\lnot\exists\ x\ [\lnot(I(x)\land C(x) \implies L(x))]\ \land\ \exists\ x\ [\lnot(I(x)\land C(x))]$    
f) $\lnot\forall\ x\ [\lnot(L(x)\implies \lnot C(x))]$  
g) $\exists\ x\ [\lnot(I(x)\and C(x))]$  
h) $\forall\ x\ [\lnot(C(x)\implies \lnot L(x))]$
```
3. State whether the following arguments are valid or invalid. You do not need to know the domain or interpretation to determine this.

    a) $\forall(x) [P(x)\land Q(x)])\ :\ \forall(x) [P(x)]$
    b) $\exists(x) [\lnot P(x)\land Q(x)]\ :\ \forall (x) [P(x)\lor Q(x)]$
    c) $\forall(x) [P(x)\lor Q(x)]\ :\ \exists(x) [Q(x)]$
    d) $\exists(x) [\lnot Q(x)]\ :\ \exists(x) [L(x)]$
    e) $\forall(x) [P(x)]\ :\ \lnot\exists(x)[\lnot P(x)]$

```{dropdown} **Solutions**
a) This is a valid argument, by $\land$-elimination.
b) This is invalid. We cannot conclude anything about what is true $\forall(x)$ from this premise.
c) This is invalid. The premise could be true if $\forall(x)[P(x)]$ and we cannot make this conclusion about $Q(x)$.
d) This is invalid. $\exists(x) [\lnot Q(x)]$ is true if $\forall(x) [\lnot Q(x)]$, which would not invalidate the conclusion.
e) This is valid. If $P(x)$ is true for all $x$, then there cannot be an $x$ for which $P(x)$ is false.
```
