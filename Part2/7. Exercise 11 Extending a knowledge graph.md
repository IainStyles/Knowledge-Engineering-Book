# Exercises 11: Extending a Knowledge Graph

Extend the ontology and knowledge base developed in the lectures to include a new entity called `program`. This should represent represent a whole program of study such as the MSc in AI on which you are all enrolled.

Introduce new properties and adapt the existing properties such that

* Students are enrolled on a programme of study rather than on modules directly.
* Programmes should have a programme director.

Your should create two instances of the new entity:

* MSc Artificial Intelligence, which uses the modules we have already defined.
* MSc Cyber Security, which has modules “Networks” and “Cryptography”, and also includes the “Machine Learning Module” from the MSc AI.

Enroll some students and assign staff to the modules. Assign a programme director to each programme.

Write a SPARQL query to find all students taking a module.

A basic implementation can be completed using the constructs we have already used, however, you may wish to explore the documentation to, for example, ensure each student can only be registered on one programme, or to introduce inverse properties to make certain relations bidirectional.
